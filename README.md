# LAADSImageProcess
Scripts to process LAADS DAAP downloads from native download file types to .jpg images.
Contact: B Steele (B.Steele@colostate.edu)

Scrtips are in development unless otherwise noted.

First process to true color, then play with band boost options.

Ideal application is to output real-time .jpg from LAADS. (Will need to use API to grab these data, maybe in a GH action?)
